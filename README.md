## WORK DAY PLANNER - HOMEWORK_5

\*EARLY STEPS
-Set up a JS file
-Create 9 different time-block rows in HTML -
-Create my dependencies and variables

\*NEXT STEPS
-I read through the documentation of Moment.JS and after a long period of trial and error and collaboration, figured out how to retrieve the time/date and display it on the page -
-Put my efforts into the next big sections: 1. Changing the colors of the rows as time progressed 2. Create a function my save buttons 3. Figure out local storage.

\*CHANGING COLORS
-Created an each loop to run through all of my time blocks.
-I retrieved each separate time block by their id's and had to split the name of the IDs just to search for the correct number.
-I created variables that represented the value of each time block's id and the current time.
-Then I compared those two variables to each other and added the classes of past, present, and future that were already provided to me in the CSS as time progresses.

\*SAVE BUTTON
-After long hours of research, I figured out how to create the correct variables I needed (one for the time block and one for the user input text content) and I stored those variables as a pair in local storage.

\*RETRIEVING FROM LOCAL STORAGE
-I had to do more research on how to use jQuery notation to retrieve content from local storage and store them properly in their correct places.
-Since they were stored as a pair, I had to call BOTH sections as a pair as well to ensure that my text content landed in the correct time block.
-This part took me the most time.

\*FINAL TOUCHES
-Added some simple styling changes to make it more visually appealing
-Tested all functionality multiple times.

\*\*I know I didn't commit as much with this assignment. I definitely should have committed more, but once I got rolling, I didn't feel like stopping my momentum.
